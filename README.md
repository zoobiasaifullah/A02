# Git and GitHub
Git is version control system. A version control system tracks and saves changes made to your file over time on your local hard drive. This system allows you to review and restore earlier versions of your code when needed.
GitHub is an online database that allows you to keep track of and share your Git version control projects outside of your local computer/server. Unlike Git, GitHub is exclusively cloud-based.
